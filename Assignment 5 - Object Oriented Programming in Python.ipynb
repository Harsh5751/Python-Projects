    "## Background\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "In physics, many kinematics problems can be simply modelled using a particle, or point mass, approximation. A one-dimensional particle with mass $m$ travels in only one direction, and has a position $r$, velocity $v$, and acceleration $a$ that change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    " In a numerical simulation of a particle, the flow of time is approximated by using intervals. For a period of time $t$ split into $n$ intervals, the change in time over each interval is given by $\\Delta t = \\frac{t}{n}$. The smaller $\\Delta t$ is ($n$ is large), the better the approximation becomes. For a given time interval $\\Delta t$, the position $r$ and velocity $v$ for a particle are updated as follows:\n",
    "$$r_{\\mathit{new}} = r_{\\mathit{last}} + v_{\\mathit{last}}\\cdot\\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot a \\cdot \\Delta t^2$$\n",
    "$$v_{\\mathit{new}} = v_{\\mathit{last}} + a \\cdot \\Delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_{\\mathit{new}}$ and $v_{\\mathit{new}}$ are the new (updated) position and velocity of the particle, and $r_{\\mathit{last}}$ and $v_{\\mathit{last}}$ are the position and velocity during the last interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program will simulate a particle being fired from a cannon into the air, then being pulled back to the ground by gravity. A mass $m$ will experience an initial energy input $E$, setting its velocity according to the following equation:\n",
    "$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\cdot E}{m}}$$\n",
    "                                    \n",
    "Design, implement, and test a program that satisfies the requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "1. The library includes a Python class named `Particle1D`. (Note: **1** in Particle**1**D is the number one) <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `__init__` method for `Particle1D` takes first formal parameter `self` and four numbers $m$, $r_0$, $v_0$, and $a_0$ as input **in that order**, and stores each of them as a class instance variable. $m$, $r$, $v$ and $a$ represent the mass, starting position, starting velocity, and starting acceleration of the particle, respectively.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The class contains accessors for $m$, $r$, $v$, and $a$. The names of the accessors are `getM()`, `getR()`, `getV()` and `getA()`, respectively. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The class contains a mutator `update(self, delta_t)` that has a first formal parameter `self` and a normal parameter time interval $\\Delta t$ , and updates $r$ and $v$ according to the formulas above. Be careful not to use $v_{\\mathit{new}}$ in the calculation for $r_{\\mathit{new}}$.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The class contains a method `isOnGround(self)`, that has first formal parameter `self` and returns `True` if $r \\le 0$, and `False` otherwise.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  The class contains a mutator `fireCannon(self, energy):` that has a first formal parameter `self` and a normal parameter $energy$, and sets $v$ according to the energy formula above. Note that $v$ is re-calculated directly from $E$, and $m$.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Outside** the class there should be a function `runCannonSim(delta_t, energy, gravity, mass)` that takes a time interval $\\Delta t$, a float `energy`, a float `gravity`, and a float `mass` as input, and simulates a mass being fired from a cannon into the air. First, a `Particle1D` object is created with mass `mass`, initial position `0`, initial velocity `0`, and initial acceleration `gravity`. The particle is then fired from the cannon using `energy` and `fireCannon`. The simulation will run until the particle hits the ground ($r\\le0$). Each \"cycle\" of the simulation recalculates the position and velocity of the particle using $\\Delta t$ and `update`. The function should return a list containing the starting point of the particle, and its new position ($r$) at the end of each cycle. For example, if the particle has a `mass` = 10, `energy` = 1000 and `delta_t` = 0.4, the returned list will look something like: `[0.0, 8.177708498984762, 9.914562748477142, 10.083416997969522, 8.6842712474619, 5.71712549695428, 1.1819797464466593, -4.921166004060961]`.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The program requires very little besides the function definitions. There is no main().<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Your name, MacID, student number, and the date are given in comments at the top of the first Python cell below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Your answers to the design questions and test plan are given in the appropriate Markdown cells below.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Your program MUST have valid Python syntax and it must run without errors. Ensure that your program runs properly by running it before you submit.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. You must sign out with a TA or IAI after you have submitted your lab at the submission station. Failure to do so could result in a mark of zero.\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "## Design and Implementation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may assume that inputs will be within a valid range and of the correct type, and that exception handling is not necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Follow the function syntax **EXACTLY** as given, including spelling, capitalization and the order of function paramaters.\n",
    "\n",
